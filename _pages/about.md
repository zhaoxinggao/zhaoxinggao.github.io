I am currently a Professor of Statistics at the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.uestc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) in Chengdu, China. Prior to this, I held the position of ZJU100 Young Professor at the Center for Data Science, Zhejiang University. I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, under the supervision of Prof. Shiqing Ling. My postdoctoral research took place at the London School of Economics and Political Science (2016-2017) with Prof. Qiwei Yao, followed by a position at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business (2017-2019) under the mentorship of Prof. Ruey Tsay. Before returning to China, I served as a tenure-track assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics at Lehigh University (2019-2021).
